     * A method to determine if the provided trampolines will result in happy
     * llamas.
     *
     * When llamas get together they like to bounce on trampolines. However,
     * llamas are very particular about the proper number of trampolines, and
     * are usually only happy if there are between 24 to 42 (inclusive!). This
     * only changes if the trampolines are made of ultra-bouncey NASA fabric. In
     * those cases, while they still require at LEAST 24, the llamas figure the
     * more trampolines the better!
     *
     * return true if the llamas will be happy with their trampolines, or false
     * otherwise.
     *
     * Example Results: areTheLlamasHappy(false, 10) → false
     * areTheLlamasHappy(false, 24) → true 
     * areTheLlamasHappy(true, 50) → true
     *
     * @param ultraBouncy True if trampolines are made of UltraBouncy NASA
     *                    fabric.
     * @param trampolines The number of trampolines
     * @return boolean indicating if the llama's are happy
